# A Solid New Years Tutorial

So this is one of the very first times I've ever used Solid JS and I'm trying to get to 1,000 commits. I don't have a lot of time to spend on the README but I am excited. Kind of. I don't understand solid very well yet so hopefully I'll learn a little something and make something kind of cool. Here we go!
